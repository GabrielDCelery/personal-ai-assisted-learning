# What is this repository for?

This repo is an experiment to use AI as a tool to learn about different subjects.

I ask the AI to create a series of lessons for me that I follow and since it is an AI unlike a Udemy course I get the opportuinity to ask for clarification and feedback on the spot.

Kind a like having a personal tutor.

# Lesson series

`channels` - wanted to get a better understanding of go channels
`docker` - learn docker starting from the basics
`kubernetes` - learn kubernetes starting from the basics
